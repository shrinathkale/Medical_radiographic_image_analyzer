The Medical Radiographic Image Analyzer is an intelligent system designed to analyze radiographic medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and similar diagnostic images to predict whether a specific organ is normal or defective. The project uses image processing and machine learning / deep learning techniques to identify patterns, abnormalities, and structural variations present in radiographic images.
The system assists in early detection of medical conditions by providing automated analysis based on learned patterns from labeled radiographic datasets. It aims to support healthcare professionals by offering fast and consistent preliminary assessments of medical images.
